No this is not some `LOVEINT` repo. After I'm done finishing this, there will be tables at Olive Garden reserved.

## update your `.vimrc` 

Now you don't need to start from scratch. If you're girlfriend is coming over (or perhaps a first date!) go the extra mile to impress them with your `.vimrc`. In fact I'd even use `tmux`. Navigate `NERDTree` like you've never done before. This is my `.vimrc` I made, this was for when my last date came over:

```vim
" Hello, and welcome to my Vim setup! Tonight, let's make you seeing my screen an unforgettable experience!

" General Settings
set number                " Show line numbers
set relativenumber        " Show relative line numbers
set tabstop=4             " Set tab size to 4 spaces
set softtabstop=4         " Set soft tabstop to 4 spaces
set expandtab             " Use spaces instead of tabs
set shiftwidth=4          " Set indentation width to 4 spaces
set autoindent            " Auto-indent new lines
set cursorline            " Highlight current line
set hlsearch              " Highlight search results
set incsearch             " Incremental search
set ignorecase            " Case insensitive search
set smartcase             " Case sensitive if there is a capital letter in the search

" Theme and Appearance
syntax enable             " Enable syntax highlighting
colorscheme desert        " Set color scheme to desert (feel free to choose another)
set background=dark       " Use dark background

" Key mappings
nnoremap <C-n> :NERDTreeToggle<CR> " Toggle NERDTree with Ctrl + n

" Plugin Settings
" Add your favorite plugins and configurations here

" Customizations
" Add any additional customizations or preferences here

" Happy coding, nice2meetu!

## what happens if a programming snafu happens

It happens to all of us, just open a terminal and run `killall` and go back to importing those dependencies without a `requirements.txt` file, you're a bad boy!

## some reminders 

Don't use the Wife n Life Calculator that Patrick Steadman and I made. The seven question sequence is probably going to get you a low score, it's 2024. Don't put much merit into it.

## she brought her bro friend over who knows nothing about programming

Some topics you could discuss:

* RobinHood
* Plaid
* Stripe
* Braintree (possibly)
* Acorns
* Make the joke "How does NerdWallet make money?"
* Say "Haha, yeah I knew a guy over at AppDynamics once as well." (This is already under the conditional this person knows someone from AppDynamics.)
* Saying #2 "Yeah, I vaguely remember a company called Percolate. I think everyone there was attractive."
* Saying #3 "Totally into Dashboards, I think at work we use Heap or maybe something internal. I forget."
* Saying #4 "You ever run `--emerge sync` on Gentoo?"
